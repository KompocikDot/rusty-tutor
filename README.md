Everything can be changed, I'm still learning a lot, new techniques and patterns.

## Technologies used
- `actix-web`
- `sqlx`

### Important! Atm backend docker build is not working due to: [Git issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/10781) **I don't have time atm to make image myself, just waiting for rust 1.68 rust image**
